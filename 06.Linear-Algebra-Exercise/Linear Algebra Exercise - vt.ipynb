    "### Problem 2. Vectorization in `numpy`\n",
    "As programmers, we're used to writing for-loops to iterate over collections. This is quite OK but in Python makes the code slow (because it's an interpreted, dynamically-typed language). For example, a \"standard\" way of summing an array would be\n",

    "2. Communication between C and Python is slow\n",
    "\n",

In some cases, the performance difference will be several hundred times (e.g. length = $1.10^7$, difference $\\approx 2000$ times: $\\approx 0.01ms$ for the `sum()` and $\\approx 2s$ for the loop).\n",
